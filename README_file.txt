DATA SOURCES
---------------
Billboard.com statistics were scraped using the BeautifulSoup package within Python. The code looped through each week by using the URL format https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}/. The webscrape was able to collect song title, artist name, Billboard rank, peak position on the Billboard, and number of weeks on the Billboard.

Spotify metrics were extracted using a Python library for the Spotify Web API called Spotipy. User can look up songs, albums, artists, and playlists by calling Spotify's unique URI (uniform resource identifier). Spotipy offers a wide range of information including but not limited to: song title, song popularity, artist name, artist popularity, number of artist followers, artist genre, album name, and release date. Audio features are also available describing: duration (ms), danceability, energy, loudness, key, mode, instrumentalness, acousticness, liveness, speechiness, valence, tempo (bpm) and time signature.

Song lyrics were extracted using a Python library for the Genius API called lyricsgenius. Users can search for lyrics using built-in search methods by artist name or title name. The content on Genius is user-generated which means it requires careful validation or in some cases a manual override.

Finally, datasets from Kaggle and data.world were sampled in order to build up class 0 (songs that did not reach Billboard Hot100). The links to those sources are:

- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imuhammad/audio-features-and-lyrics-of-spotify-songs

HOUSEKEEPING NOTES
---------------
- Make sure all files are within the same folder as the working Jupyter notebooks.
- The three files that start with "dataset_" are not needed nor will they be produced from any of the code. They are the raw files before being merged to 'capstone_dataset_raw.csv'. Is is there for reference or verification.
- The code from 'Capstone Project - 2. Data Transformation.ipynb' will require the 'capstone_dataset_raw.csv' file. Once the code runs, the following files will be generated: 'capstone_dataset_clean.csv' and 'capstone_dataset_artists.csv'and 'capstone_dataset_genre.csv'
- The last section of 'Capstone Project - 5. Text Analysis with NLP.ipynb' will save a .pkl file whhich will then be used in the 'Capstone Project - 6. Data Visualization.ipynb' workbook
