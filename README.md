# Predicting Billboard Hot100 Song Hits
Using machine learning and NLP to predict Billboard Hot100 song hits.

INTRODUCTION
---------------
What is a song? On Merriam-Webster, it states that a song is merely a “short musical composition of words and music”. That leads us to our problem statement: 

> How can we analyze a song’s words and music such that we can predict the probability of its success?
    
Before answering that question, we need define what success means first. In this project, we are using the Billboard Hot100 chart as a measurement of success. Since 1958, Billboard Hot100 has been the music industry’s standard record chart in the United States for the top 100 songs. The algorithm is based on physical and digital sales, radio play, and online streaming activity from platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, Pandora, etc. 

And while it may have been once easy for major label artists like Katy Perry, Chris Brown, and Jay-Z to make Billboard hits, data has shown that music is evolving. The streaming era is shaping the way we produce, distribute, and consume music. It presents an [opportunity](https://firston.soundcloud.com/) for new and emerging artists to showcase their music and make their “big break” through channels like TikTok, Soundcloud, or YouTube. In fact, Spotify’s SEC filings have shown that [major label market share](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/slowly-but-surely-the-major-labels-dominance-of-spotify-is-declining/) have been steadily declining since 2017. 

#### BUSINESS VALUE:

Because of this recent and rapid change in music, companies are taking a reactive approach. In other words, they approach a new artist after their song goes viral. This project will construct a model to help both companies and artists alike to be proactive and produce a song that can be widely commercialized while keeping up current trends.
